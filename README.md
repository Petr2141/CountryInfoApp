### Architecture
MVVM + clean architecture
![[Pasted image 20240917115216.png|350]]

| Layer  | Class                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| UI     | MainActivity<br>CountriesViewModel                |
| Domain | GetSortCountriesUseCase                           |
| Data   | CountriesRepository<br>CountriesNetworkDataSource |

### Dependency Injection

Since this is a minimal project scope, I chose not to use external libraries (such as Dagger, Hilt, etc.) and instead implemented manual Dependency Injection (DI).

| Class                    | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AppContainer**         | Contains dependencies for classes in the Data layer.                                                 |
| **CountriesApplication** | Provides access to the AppContainer, facilitating access to dependencies throughout the application. |

### About the Layout Design and Implementation

At first glance, this design may seem purely schematic and may not require exact reproduction. However, a closer inspection reveals a real challenge. To begin, I sketched out a few solutions on paperâ€”this was one of the initial steps in visualizing the concept. Here's a screenshot of my notes:
![[scatch.jpg|400]]

In a real project, we would likely adhere to industry guidelines from Google: [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/). We would be particularly focused on responsiveness, expected user behavior, and what is commonly referred to as UX (User Experience).

However, in this case, we are implementing the design exactly as specified in the assignment:
![[Pasted image 20240923183525.png]]

During the implementation, I paid attention to several aspects:

| Aspect                 | Importance                                                                                     | Commit                                   |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Styles, Colors, Dimensions | For reusability, maintaining a consistent app style, and simplifying the implementation of a dark theme, etc. | e6c03efc2cf42b03744f6e1966f12d1c6204663a |
| Include / Merge       | For reusability                                                                                 | c0e1f6f90b9fa8b9b13c1bec18fbadbab872c2bd |
